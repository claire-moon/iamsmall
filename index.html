        "If I wear your face, I can smile in the mirror without forcing my muscles. It looks so real. I cry having your thoughts. They are so beautiful.\n\n" +
        "I think about me, and I realize you really do love me. You see my soul, and it's so big. So very, very, very big. As big as the sun in our sky. All of my art is beautiful poetry. Everybody wants to listen. My art is a response to light. My art is love.";
